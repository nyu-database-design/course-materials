# Database Design

Slides used to teach a survey of the nuts and bolts of using databases.

## Publishing slides

Slides are auto-generated from the materials in the `slides` folder using Git Pages.

- view any slide deck online at https://nyu-database-design.github.io/course-materials/slide-name, where _slide-name_ is replaced by the _permalink_ indicated at the top of each slide markdown file in the `slides` folder.

## Running locally
