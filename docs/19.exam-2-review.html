# Overview

template: overview

## Format

The exam will be composed of two parts:

--

- A Google Form, similar to a Quiz

--

- A GitHub Classroom repository, similar to an assignment

---

template: overview

## Time

Start anytime and submit anytime within a 24 hour window.

---

## Topics covered

The topics covered on the exam:

--

- Do you really need a slide about this?

---

template: overview

## Weighting

All topics will be weighted equally in grading.

---

name: mongodb

# MongoDB

--

template: mongodb

## Key points

Main topics:

--

- an example of a _NoSQL_ database

--

- easily imports `CSV` and `JSON` file formats

--

- _document-oriented_ - records stored as Javascript objects written with JSON

--

- Javascript objects support nesting of values

--

- normal forms need not apply

---

template: mongodb

## CRUD

CRUD is still cruddy

--

- **C**reate: `db.collection.insert(document)` -

--

- **R**ead: `db.collection.find(criteria, projection)`

--

- **U**pdate: `db.collection.update(criteria, changes, one_or_many)`,

--

- **D**elete: `db.collection.remove(criteria)`.

---

## Basic statistics

As with all database systems, MongoDB can easily do some basic statistical operations:

- Count: `db.collection.find(criteria).count()`

--

The _aggregation pipeline_ is used to calculate most other statistics...

---

template: mongodb

## Basic statistics (continued)

E.g., calculate average of all values in the `salary_range_to` field with no grouping:

```javascript
db.collection.aggregate([
  {
    $group: {
      _id: null,
      avg_val: { $avg: "$salary_range_to" },
    },
  },
]);
```

--

Calculate average of all values in the `salary_range_to` field, grouping by `agency`:

```javascript
db.collection.aggregate([
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$agency",
      avg_val: { $avg: "$salary_range_to" },
    },
  },
]);
```

--

Other statistics are calculated very similarly.

---

name: web-apps

# Web Apps

--

## Key points

Main topics:

--

- the web is the use of the `HTTP` protocol that allows a web browser to browse _hypertext_ documents

--

- a client (e.g. web browser) makes requests (e.g. `HTTP` `GET` or `POST` requests), and a server (e.g. web server) issues responses to those requests (e.g. `HTTP` `200` `OK`).

--

- `HTTP` `POST` requests can contain a payload of body data, such as when the user submits a form. `GET` requests (the default type) cannot.

--

- `flask` is a Python web server module to help detect incoming requests and respond to them

--

- `flask` allows us to set up server-side _routes_ - functions that run automatically when a browser requests a certain web address.

--

- `flask` also makes it easy to generate templates: static `HTML` documents with data injected into them dynamically.

--

- `pymongo` is a Python module that helps the server code communicate with a MongoDB databases.

---

template: web-apps

## HTML, CSS, Javascript

Web browsers can only "understand"/interpret 3 languages: `HTML`, `CSS`, Javascript`.

--

- HTML is used to indicate the content and semantic meaning of the content of a given web page.

--

- CSS is used to indicate the styling of the content on a given web page.

--

- Javascript is used to indicate any interactive behaviors of a given web page (changes to make on user `click`, `mouseover`, `keyPressed`, etc).

---

name: pandas

# Pandas

--

## Key points

Main topics:

--

- powerful Python-based data analysis library

--

- stores data in `Series` and `DataFrame` data structures

--

- vector math!

--

- relies on `numpy`, wraps around `matplotlib`

--

- includes tools to help munge/cleanup the data.

--

- supports basic data analysis: statistical analysis including grouping.

Thank you. Good luck.
