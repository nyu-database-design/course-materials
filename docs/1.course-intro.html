## Course description

Introduces principles and applications of databases.

--

We survey a variety of common database systems, starting with _plain text data formats_ and _spreadsheets_, and moving into _relational databases_, _document-oriented databases_, with a light touch of more advanced topics like _application programming interfaces (APIs)_ and _blockchains_ (i.e. cryptocurrencies)

--

Students explore principles of database design and apply those principles to computer systems in general and in their respective fields of interest.

## What is a database anyway?

A database is any system or tool used for storing data.

--

- usually stores _structured_ data, although _unstructured_ data sets certainly do exist

--

- usually makes it _fast_ to find data you are looking for...

--

- ... especially data that meet _criteria_ you indicate

--

- usually easily-integrated into computer programs

---

## Conventions

While there might be, in theory, many different kinds of database systems, in practice only a few kinds dominate in today's workplace.

--

We will explore a few representatives of the most popular kinds.

## Database systems

We will look in some detail at a few database systems:

--

- Text-based data formats (e.g. _CSV_, _JSON_, _XML_)

--

- Spreadsheets (e.g. Microsoft _Excel_, Google _Sheets_, Apple _Numbers_, OpenOffice _Calc_)

--

- *SQL*ite (an example of a _relational database_)

--

- _MongoDB_ (an example of a document-oriented database)

--

- _Pandas_ (a Python module for data analysis)

---

## Teasers into other topics

We will take **brief looks** at a few exciting topics that might lead you towards future directions that interest you:

--

- Connecting databases to _web apps_

--

- Application programming interfaces (_APIs_)

--

- _Data visualization_

--

- Blockchain, _bitcoin_, and other cryptocurrencies

---

## Skills we will develop

You cannot do contemporary work with data and databases without honing a few skills:

--

- _Python_ programming

--

- _Jupyter Notebooks_

--

- _SQL_ programming

--

- Version control (i.e. `git`)

---

template: topics

## Questions we will answer

There are common questions we will aim to answer:

--

- How do I set up my computer so I can work on data problems effectively?

--

- What are the most common problems that databases are designed to solve?

--

- How do you solve those problems?

--

- What are some of the considerations when choosing one database over another?

--

- How do I set up a database properly in a well-organized fashion?

--

- My internship requires me to know SQL.... what is that?

--

- My friend is making mad money at a start-up using MongoDB... can I learn that?
