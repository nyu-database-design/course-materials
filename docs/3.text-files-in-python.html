# Overview

template: overview

## Intro
Python programmers use a variety of techniques for manipulating data in plain text files.  We will take a look at a few.

---

name: opening

# Opening text files

---

template: opening

## Modes of opening
A Pytyhon program can open a file in one of three modes:

--

- *read* - the program will be able to read data from the file

--

- *write* - the program will be able to completely overwrite the file's data

--

- *append* - the program will be able to add new data at the end of the file

---

template: opening

## open(...) function
Python's built-in `open()` function is the main tool for opening text files.

--

```python
f = open('amazing_data.txt', 'r') # open the file in read mode
```

--

```python
f = open('amazing_data.txt', 'w') # open the file in write mode
# if the file does not yet exist, it will be automatically created
```

--

```python
f = open('amazing_data.txt', 'a') # open the file in append mode
# if the file does not yet exist, it will be automatically created
```

--

- In each of these examples, the variable, `f`, will refer to the file that has been opened.

--

- Further operations can be done on the data in the file through this `f` variable.

---

name: reading

# Reading data from text files

---

template: reading

## Basic concept
There are multiple ways to read data from a file in Python.  Which way you choose depends upon your needs.

--

- `f.read()` - returns the entire contents of the file as a *string*

--

- `f.readline()` - returns the next available single line of text (including the line break) as a *string*

--

- `f.readlines()` - returns a *list* containing all lines of the file as the values in the list

--

- *for loop* - can be used to iterate through the lines of a file

---

template: reading

## f.read()
Returns the entire contents of the file as a *string*.

--

```python
f = open('amazing_data.txt', 'r') # open the file in read mode

all_text = f.read() # returns the entire contents of the file as a strings

# now do something fantastic and interesting with the data in all_text
```

---

template: reading

## f.readline()
Returns the next available single line of text (including the line break) as a *string*.

--

```python
f = open('amazing_data.txt', 'r') # open the file in read mode

first_line = f.readline() # returns the first available line as a string (including line break)
second_line = f.readline() # returns the next available line as a string (including line break)
# ... and so on

# now do something fantastic and interesting with the data in first_line, second_line, etc.
```

--

Often, you want to remove the line break character from the end of each line.

--

```python
f = open('amazing_data.txt', 'r') # open the file in read mode

first_line = f.readline() # returns the first available line as a string (including line break)
first_line = first_line.strip()

second_line = f.readline() # returns the next available line as a string (including line break)
second_line = second_line.strip()
# ... and so on
```

---

template: reading

## f.readlines()
Returns a *list* containing all lines of the file as the values in the list.

--

```python
f = open('amazing_data.txt', 'r') # open the file in read mode

all_lines = f.readlines() # returns a *list* containing all lines of the file as the values in the list.

# now do something fantastic and interesting with the data in all_lines
```


---

template: reading

## for loops
It is possible to iterate through the lines of a file using a *for loop*.

--

```python
f = open('amazing_data.txt', 'r') # open the file in read mode

for line in f:
    line = line.strip() # remove the line break character

    # now do something fantastic and interesting with the data in line

```

--

- The loop will automatically terminate once it reaches the end of the file.

--

- This is often the easiest way to iterate through each line of a file and do something with it

---

name: writing

# Writing data to text files

---

template: writing

## Basic concept
Files can be either written from scratch or appended to, depending on whether the file is opened in *write* or *append* mode.

--

- `f = open('amazing_data.txt', 'w') # open the file in write mode`

--

- `f = open('amazing_data.txt', 'a') # open the file in append mode`

--

- In either mode, the `f.write()` function is used to write new text to the file.

--

- In either case, one *must* explicitly close the file with `f.close()` after writing to it.

---

template: writing

## Writing from scratch
In *write* mode, a file is created from scratch.  If the file already exists, it will be completely overwritten.

--

```python
f = open('amazing_data.txt', 'w') # open the file in write mode
```

--

```python
f.write("'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves")
f.write("Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:")
f.write("All mimsy were the borogoves,")
f.write("And the mome raths outgrabe.")
```

--

Close the file at the end.... *writing will not work without closing*.

--

```python
f.close() # close the file to finish the job
```
---

template: writing

## Appending
In *append* mode, an existing file is opened and added to.  If the file does not yet exist, it will be automatically created.

--

```python
f = open('amazing_data.txt', 'a') # open the file in append mode
```

--

```python
f.write('"Beware the Jabberwock, my son!')
f.write('The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!')
f.write('Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun')
f.write('The frumious Bandersnatch!"')
```

--

Close the file at the end.... *writing will not work without closing*.

--

```python
f.close() # close the file to finish the job
```

--

The file now contains the first two stanzas of Lewis Carroll's [Jabberwocky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jabberwocky).

---

name: encoding

# Encoding issues

---

template: encoding

## Basic concept
Behind the scenes, plain text files contain only *ASCII* or *Unicode* codes, i.e. numbers in one of those encoding systems that represent characters.

--

- One day, you will open a document that is supposed to shows plain text, but you will see *garbled characters* and become confused.
```bash
ÉGÉìÉRÅ[ÉfÉBÉìÉOÇÕìÔÇµÇ≠Ç»Ç¢
```

--

- If you have written a program to read this file, it will most likely *crash*.

--

- There is one explanation: *the program you have used to open this file is assuming the wrong encoding*.

---

template: encoding

## Specify an encoding
Most applications (editors, web browsers, etc) allow you to *select the encoding* in which to open the file.  Try a few until you find the correct one.

--

Python's default encoding when opening a file depends on the computer it's running on.  

--

- *UTF-8*, one of several encodings in the *Unicode* standard, is often the encoding you want (but not always).
--

```python
f = open('amazing_data.txt', 'r', encoding='utf_8') # open in read mode with the common UTF-8 Unicode encoding
```

--

- See the full set of [character encodings supported by Python](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/codecs.html#standard-encodings).

--

---

name: csv

# Comma-Separated Values (CSV)

---

template: csv

## Basic concept
Python's [csv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html) module includes many functions useful for manipulating Comma-Separated Values (CSV) data.

---

template: csv

## Example
Take a CSV file, `nonsense.csv`, with famous nonsense literature works:

--

```csv
Last name,First name,Title,Year
Carroll,Lewis,Jabberwocky,1871
Lear,Edward,The Jumblies,1910
Bishop,Elizabeth,The Man-Moth,1946
```

--

Let's print out the title of each work using the `csv` module:

--

```python
import csv

f = open('nonsense.csv', 'r')
csv_reader = csv.reader(f)

for line in csv_reader:
    print( line["Title"] )

```

---

name: json

# Javascript Object Notation (JSON)

---

template: json

## Basic concept
Python's [json](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html) module includes many functions useful for manipulating Javascript Ojbect Notation (JSON) data.

---

template: json

## Example
Take a JSON file, `nonsense.json`, with famous nonsense literature works:

--

```json
[
    {"lastName": "Carroll", "firstName": "Lewis", "title": "Jaberwocky", "year": 1871},
    {"lastName": "Lear", "firstName": "Edward", "title": "The Jumblies", "year": 1910},
    {"lastName": "Bishop", "firstName": "Elizabeth", "title": "The Man-Moth", "year": 1946}
]
```

--

Let's print out the title of each work using the `json` module:

--

```python
import json

f = open('nonsense.json', 'r')
all_text = f.read() # get all text in file as a string

list_of_works = json.loads(all_text) # return a list of all works

# loop through each literature work
for work in list_of_works:
    print( work["title"] )
```

---

name: pandas

# The pandas in the room

--

## One module to rule them all
[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is an exceptionally powerful library for data analysis.

--

- It allows for easy reading of both CSV and JSON data files.

--

```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('nonsense.csv') 
print( df['Title'] ) # output all titles
```

--

```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_json('nonsense.json', orient='columns') 
print( df['title'] ) # output all titles
```

--

- pandas can do much more than this.

---

name: html

# HyperText Markup Language

--

## Warning
While HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is one of the most common sources of loosely-structured and unstructured data today, it is *difficult to parse manually* due to its idiosyncratic syntax.

--

- Don't try to parse HTML manually... it's too much work.

--

- Use a readymade module such as [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) instead.

---

template: html

## Extraction with Beautiful Soup
Take, for example, the following HTML file named `nonsense.html`:

--

```html
<doctype html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <title>Famous Works of Nonsense Literature</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <section>
            <h1>Famous Works of Nonsense Literature</h1>
            <article>
                <h2>Jabberwocky</h2>
                <p>by Lewis Carroll<br />1871</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h2>The Jumblies</h2>
                <p>by Edward Lear<br />1910</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h2>The Man-Moth</h2>
                <p>by Elizabeth Bishop<br />1946</p>
            </article>
        </section>
    </body>
</html>
```

---

template: html

## Extraction with Beautiful Soup
The following Python program will *extract the titles* of each work of nonsense literature.

--

```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

f = open('nonsense.html', 'r') # open the file in read mode
contents = f.read() # returns the entire contents of the file as a string
soup = BeautifulSoup(contents, 'lxml') # use Beautiful Soup to parse the html

# find all h1 tags and iterate through them
for tag in soup.find_all('h1'):

    # print out the contents of each h1 tag
    print( tag.text )
```
