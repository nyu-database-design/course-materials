# Overview

## Introduction

What are the normal forms in relational database design theory?

- Guidelines for _how to design records_.

--

- They are _general in nature_, and apply to any relational database system.

--

- They are _designed to prevent rendundancy, ambiguity, anomalies, and data inconsistencies_.

--

- They _tend to penalize retrieval_ (i.e. reading with `SELECT` statements), since data which may have been retrievable from one record in an unnormalized design may have to be retrieved from several records using a **join** in the normalized form.

--

- There is _no obligation to fully normalize_ all records when actual performance requirements are taken into account.

---

## Redundancy

One of the goals of normalization is to avoid data redundancy - the repetition of facts in multiple places within the data.

--

An example table to hold `students`' grades', with lots of redundancy.

| **id** | name             | email                      | assessment_title | grade |
| :----- | :--------------- | :------------------------- | :--------------- | :---- |
| 1      | John I. Rivero   | JohnIRivero@jourrapide.com | Quiz #1          | 95    |
| 2      | John I. Rivero   | JohnIRivero@jourrapide.com | Quiz #2          | 78    |
| 3      | John I. Rivero   | JohnIRivero@jourrapide.com | Midterm Exam     | 82    |
| 4      | Susan C. Anthony | AnthonySusan@bmoney.com    | Quiz #2          | 64    |
| ...    | ...              | ...                        | ...              | ...   |

## Anomalies

Another goal is to avoid **anomalies**, which come in three types.

- Insertion anomalies

- Update anomalies

- Deletion anomalies

---

template: overview

## Insertion anomalies

Insertion anomalies occur when we are not able to insert certain attributes in the database without the presence of other attributes.

--

- For example, if we wanted to add a new student to our records, but couldn't do so because they hadn't yet taken any assessments, and we had mistakenly made the `assessment_title` and `grade` fields `NOT NULL`.

| **id** | name             | email                      | assessment_title | grade |
| :----- | :--------------- | :------------------------- | :--------------- | :---- |
| 1      | John I. Rivero   | JohnIRivero@jourrapide.com | Quiz #1          | 95    |
| 2      | John I. Rivero   | JohnIRivero@jourrapide.com | Quiz #2          | 78    |
| 3      | John I. Rivero   | JohnIRivero@jourrapide.com | Midterm Exam     | 82    |
| 4      | Susan C. Anthony | AnthonySusan@bmoney.com    | Quiz #2          | 64    |
| ...    | ...              | ...                        | ...              | ...   |

---

template: overview

## Update anomalies

Update anomalies occur when a correct update of a record requires other actions, such as addition, deletion or both, in order to retain data integrity.

--

- For example, if we wanted to change `John I. Rivero`'s email address, but it requires us to update multiple records.

| **id** | name             | email                      | assessment_title | grade |
| :----- | :--------------- | :------------------------- | :--------------- | :---- |
| 1      | John I. Rivero   | JohnIRivero@jourrapide.com | Quiz #1          | 95    |
| 2      | John I. Rivero   | JohnIRivero@jourrapide.com | Quiz #2          | 78    |
| 3      | John I. Rivero   | JohnIRivero@jourrapide.com | Midterm Exam     | 82    |
| 4      | Susan C. Anthony | AnthonySusan@bmoney.com    | Quiz #2          | 64    |
| ...    | ...              | ...                        | ...              | ...   |

---

template: overview

## Deletion anomalies

Deletion anomalies occur when you delete a record, but because of the design of the tables, you accidentally delete information you shouldn't have.

--

- For example, if `Helen C. Gonzalez` has only taken one assessment, Quiz #1, but we decide to drop that grade. Deleting that record would remove her email address entirely from our student data.

| **id** | name              | email                         | assessment_title | grade |
| :----- | :---------------- | :---------------------------- | :--------------- | :---- |
| 4      | Susan C. Anthony  | AnthonySusan@bmoney.com       | Quiz #2          | 64    |
| 5      | Mary G. Dickinson | MaryGDickinson@jourrapide.com | Quiz #1          | 95    |
| 6      | JSandra B. Kile   | SandraBKile@teleworm.us       | Quiz #2          | 78    |
| 7      | Helen C. Gonzalez | HelenCGonzalez@teleworm.us    | Quiz #1          | 82    |
| ...    | ...               | ...                           | ...              | ...   |

# First Normal Form

--

## Introduction

First normal form deals with the **shape** of a record type.

--

- All records in a table must contain _the same number of fields_.

--

- In other words, all tables in relational database systems have a _fixed schema_.

--

- A fixed schema is generally a requirement of modern relational database systems, and requires no extra work.

--

- All values in a given field should also be _singular values_.

---

name: second

# Second Normal Form

--

## Introduction

Second and third normal forms both deal with **the relationship between non-key and key fields**.

--

- Each record in second and third normal forms _must satisfy first normal form_.

--

- A non-key field _must provide a fact about the entity uniquely identified by the primary key_.

--

- It is not allowed for a non-key field to provide a fact about only a part of that entity or about some other unrelated entity.

--

- The fact could be a one-to-many relationship, such as the department of an employee, or a one-to-one relationship, such as the spouse of an employee.

---

template: second

## Applicability

Second normal form _only applies to tables whose primary key is composed of two or more fields_.

--

```sql
CREATE TABLE (
    part TEXT NOT NULL
    warehouse TEXT NOT NULL
    quantity INTEGER
    warehouse-address TEXT
    PRIMARY KEY (part, warehouse)
)
```

--

- While today it is possible to create such **composite keys**, it is increasingly uncommon, in preference for singular **surrogate key** fields containing an auto-incrementing arbitrary integer.

--

- Nevertheless, we will explore it.

---

template: second

## Example

Take, for example, the following table showing parts inventories in various warehouses:

--

| **part**                                                        | **warehouse** | quantity | warehouse-address                |
| :-------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------ | :------- | :------------------------------- |
| Baby Bed Crib Screws Hardware Replacement Kit, cSeao 25-Set     | Avenel, NJ    | 2441     | 275 Omar Ave, Avenel, NJ 07001   |
| Prime-Line N 7534 Bi-Fold Door Hardware Repair Kit              | Florence, NJ  | 1121     | 309 Cedar Ln, Florence, NJ 08518 |
| HIMIKI Tailgate Hardware Rebuild Kit w/Handle Bezel Latch Cable | Avenel, NJ    | 3567     | 275 Omar Ave, Avenel, NJ 07001   |
| ...                                                             | ...           | ...      | ...                              |

--

The composite primary key is composed of **part** and **warehouse**, meaning that the combination of those two fields is guaranteed to be unique for each record.

---

template: second

## Problems

This example does not meet the requirements of second normal form.

--

- The field `warehouse-address` is a fact about the `warehouse` only, not a fact about the `part`/`warehouse` combined entity that this table is about.

--

- This is unfortunate, since it requires the address of each warehouse to be repeated however many times there are parts in that warehouse.

--

- This **data redundancy** makes maintaining the data difficult. Updating a warehouses address would have to be done across many records, not just in a singular place.

--

- If there were no parts stored in a given warehouse, there would be nowhere in the database to store the address of that warehouse.

---

template: second

## Solutions

In order to normalize these records, we could easily split the data into two tables.

--

One table for `parts`:

| **part**                                                        | warehouse_id | quantity |
| :-------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------- | :------- |
| Baby Bed Crib Screws Hardware Replacement Kit, cSeao 25-Set     | 1            | 2441     |
| Prime-Line N 7534 Bi-Fold Door Hardware Repair Kit              | 2            | 1121     |
| HIMIKI Tailgate Hardware Rebuild Kit w/Handle Bezel Latch Cable | 1            | 3567     |
| ...                                                             | ...          | ...      |

--

And another for `warehouses`:

| **id** | address                          |
| :----- | :------------------------------- |
| 1      | 275 Omar Ave, Avenel, NJ 07001   |
| 2      | 309 Cedar Ln, Florence, NJ 08518 |
| ...    | ...                              |

# Third Normal Form

--

## Introduction

As with second normal form, third normal forms deals with **the relationship between non-key and key fields**.

--

- Records in third normal form must _satisfy second normal form_.

--

- Third normal form is _violated when a non-key field is a fact about another non-key field_.

--

- Whereas second normal form is only applicable to tables with composite primary keys, third normal form applies to all tables.

---

template: third

## Example

Take, for example, a table about `employees` at a company.

| **id** | employee            | department | location          |
| :----- | :------------------ | :--------- | :---------------- |
| 1      | Henry K. Brinkman   | Accounting | Fort Myers, FL    |
| 2      | Darlene R. Gonzalez | Marketing  | Jackson, MS       |
| 3      | Abigail W. Wagner   | Sales      | Pleasantville, NJ |
| 4      | Norella T. Walker   | Accounting | Fort Myers, FL    |
| ...    | ...                 | ...        | ...               |

--

- Let's assume that the `location` is dependent upon the `department`, with each department having a different location.

---

template: third

## Problems

This example does not meet the requirements of third normal form.

--

- The `id` field is the primary key and represents an employee. If each department is located in one place, then the `location` field is a fact about the `department`, and not a fact about the employee.

--

- The department's location is repeated in the record of every employee assigned to that department. If the location of the department changes, every such record must be updated.

--

- Because of the **redundancy**, the data might become inconsistent, with different records showing different locations for the same department.

--

- If a department has no employees, there may be no record in which to keep the department's location.

---

template: third

## Solution

As with violations of second normal form, the solution to a violation of third normal form is typically to split the data into multiple tables.

--

One table for `employees`:

| **id** | employee            | department_id |
| :----- | :------------------ | :------------ |
| 1      | Henry K. Brinkman   | 1             |
| 2      | Darlene R. Gonzalez | 2             |
| 3      | Abigail W. Wagner   | 3             |
| 4      | Norella T. Walker   | 1             |
| ...    | ...                 | ...           |

--

And another for `departments`:

| **id** | department | location          |
| :----- | :--------- | :---------------- |
| 1      | Accounting | Fort Myers, FL    |
| 2      | Marketing  | Jackson, MS       |
| 3      | Sales      | Pleasantville, NJ |
| ...    | ...        | ...               |

# Fourth Normal Form

--

## Introduction

Fourth normal form is concerned with multi-valued facts, which we'll show by example. In order for a record to meet fourth normal form, it must:

--

- satisfy the requirements of third normal form.

--

- **not** contain more than one independent **multi-valued fact** about an entity.

---

template: fourth

## Example

For example, consider a situation where we intend to store employee's skills and foreign language abilities.

--

A single employee who has multiple skills and/or multiple languages (two independent multi-valued facts about them) might [erroneously] be represented with two or more independent multi-valued fact fields.

--

| **id** | employee          | skill | language |
| :----- | :---------------- | :---- | :------- |
| 1      | Henry K. Brinkman | cook  |          |
| 2      | Henry K. Brinkman | type  |          |
| 3      | Henry K. Brinkman |       | French   |
| 4      | Henry K. Brinkman |       | German   |
| 5      | Henry K. Brinkman |       | Greek    |
| 6      | Norella T. Walker | type  |
| ...    | ...               | ...   | ...      |

--

- In this representation, in addition to **data redundancy**, there is **ambiguity** in the meaning of the null values - does the employee lack those abilities, are they not applicable, or are they unknown?

---

template: fourth

## Another Possibility

That same data, with two or more multi-value fact fields, might be represented a few different ways, including:

| **id** | employee          | skill | language |
| :----- | :---------------- | :---- | :------- |
| 1      | Henry K. Brinkman | cook  | French   |
| 2      | Henry K. Brinkman | type  | German   |
| 3      | Henry K. Brinkman | type  | Greek    |
| 4      | Norella T. Walker | type  | None     |
| ...    | ...               | ...   | ...      |

--

- In this representation, we have removed the null values, but we still have **redundancy** and therefore difficulty maintaining data, and what to do with employees who either have no language or no skill?

--

- Note that the `skill` and `language` fields are said in our description of the data to be **independent**. Thus, this model is forbidden by the fourth normal form.

--

- However, if a skill was dependent upon a specific language, this model would be allowed by the fourth normal form.

---

template: fourth

## Solution

The solution to remove redundancy, ambiguity, and anomalies, as with previous normal forms, is to split the data up into multiple tables.

--

One for `employees`:

| **id** | employee            |
| :----- | :------------------ |
| 1      | Henry K. Brinkman   |
| 2      | Darlene R. Gonzalez |
| 3      | Abigail W. Wagner   |
| 4      | Norella T. Walker   |
| ...    | ...                 |

---

template: fourth

## Solution (continued)

The solution, as with previous normal forms, is to split the data up into multiple tables.

Another for `employees_skills`:

| **employee_id** | **skill** |
| :-------------- | :-------- |
| 1               | cook      |
| 1               | type      |
| 2               | type      |
| 4               | type      |
| ...             | ...       |

- Note, here we use a compound primary key to make sure the employee-skill combinations are unique.

---

template: fourth

## Solution (continued again)

The solution, as with previous normal forms, is to split the data up into multiple tables.

And a third for `employees_languages`:

| **employee_id** | **language** |
| :-------------- | :----------- |
| 1               | French       |
| 1               | German       |
| 1               | Greek        |
| ...             | ...          |

- Note, here we use a compound primary key to make sure the employee-language combinations are unique.
