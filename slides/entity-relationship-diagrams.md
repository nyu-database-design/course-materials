# Overview

--

## Introduction

Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs) provide a way to document the **entities** in a database along with the **attributes** that describe them.

--

In practice, there are several styles of ER diagrams:

--

- **Chen notation** (named after the originator of ER modeling, Dr. Peter P.S. Chen)

--

- Information Engineering (IE, or “crows feet”)

--

- Unified Modeling Language (UML)

--

- Idiosyncratic styles that mix and match features of each of these

--

_We will [more-or-less] follow Chen notation._

---

name: entities

# Entities

--

## Concept

An **entity** is something about which we store data.

![Entity symbol](../files/erd/entity.svg)

--

- For example, a customer is an entity, as is a merchandise item stocked by shop.

--

- Entities are not necessarily tangible. For example, a concert or a doctor's appointment is an entity.

--

- In relational databases, we typically create a separate table for each entity.

--

- In entity relationship diagrams, entities are represented _as rectangles_ with the singular entity name inside.

---

template: entities

## Example

An example of two entities: a dog and a person.

![Dog entity](../files/erd/entity_dog.svg)

![Person entity](../files/erd/entity_person.svg)

---

name: attributes

# Attributes

--

## Concept

Entities have data that describe them... their **attributes**.

![Attribute symbol](../files/erd/attribute.svg)

--

- For example, a customer entity is usually described by a customer number, first name, last name, street, city, state, zip code, and phone number.

--

- A concert entity might be described by a title, date, location, and name of the performer.

--

- In relational databases, we typically create a fields within the table representing the entity for each attribute that describes it.

--

- In entity relationship diagrams, attributes are represented _as ellipses_ with the attribute name inside.

---

template: entities

## Example

An example of attributes of a dog:

![Dog entity](../files/erd/attributes_dog.svg)

---

template: entities

## Example

An example of attributes of a person:

![Person entity](../files/erd/attributes_person.svg)

---

template: attributes

## Primary Keys

In a logical model, some attributes are indicated as primary keys - attributes that can be used to uniquely identify each entity.

![Key attribute symbol](../files/erd/key_attribute.svg)

--

- For example, a customer entity might have a _customer id_ field that holds an arbitrary unique identifier of that customer.

--

- In entity relationship diagrams, primary key attribute names are _underlined_.

---

template: attributes

## Example

An example of attributes of a dog, with the primary key underlined:

![Key attribute symbol](../files/erd/key_attribute_dog.svg)

---

template: attributes

## Example

An example of attributes of a person, with the primary key underlined:

![Key attribute symbol](../files/erd/key_attribute_person.svg)

---

template: attributes

## Foreign Keys

Entity Relationship Diagramming purists would say that foreign key fields should not be included in the diagrams.

![Key attribute symbol](../files/erd/foreign_key_attribute.svg)

--

- See [this discussion](https://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/271264/how-to-represent-foreign-key-in-an-extended-er-model-in-chen-notation) if you find this curious or interesting.

--

- However, many often find it useful to do so.

--

- Some people put _double underlines_ under the foreign key field, although this is non-standard.

--

- Feel free to follow this non-standard if it helps you explain your ideas.

---

name: relationships

# Relationships

--

## Concept

Entities sometimes have **relationships** with one another.

![Relationship symbol](../files/erd/relationship.svg)

--

- For example, imagine we have two kinds of entities in a store: a Customer and a Product.

--

- A Customer in a Store might purchase a Product.

--

- A Student might register for a Course.

--

- An Employee works for a Company.

--

- Relationships are represented as a _rhombus_ (diamond) symbol.

---

template: attributes

## Example

An example of relationship between a dog and a person:

![Relationship symbol](../files/erd/relationship_person_owns_dog.svg)

---

template: attributes

## Example

Another example of relationship between a dog and a person:

![Relationship symbol](../files/erd/relationship_dog_bites_person.svg)

---

template: attributes

## Example

Both relationships in one diagram.

![Relationship symbol](../files/erd/relationship_owns_bites.svg)

---

template: attributes

## Example

An ERD play on the phrase, "[It's a dog eat dog world.](https://thevillageidiom.org/dog-eat-dog/)"

![Relationship symbol](../files/erd/relationship_dog_eats_dog.svg)

---

template: attributes

## Entity or Attribute?

Sometimes it may seem unclear whether a given term should be represented as an entity or as an attribute.

--

The following questions may help determine the answer to this question:

--

- Is the term of direct interest on its own?

--

- Does the term have sub-terms of its own?

--

- Could there be multiple instances of the object for a single record?

--

- Is the term often nonexistent or unknown?

--

_If the answer to any of these questions is `yes`, then the matter in question should be an entity._

---

name: cardinality

# Cardinality

--

## Concept

**Cardinality** is a jargon term meaning how many entities of each type are involved in a given relationship.

![Cardinality symbol](../files/erd/cardinality.svg)

--

The possibilities are:

--

- one-to-one

--

- one-to-many

--

- many-to-many

--

_Cardinality is indicated by numbers or letters next to each entity in the relationship._

--
Numbers represent a distinct number of the given entity involved in the relationship.

--
The letters, `M` and `N`, indicate multiples of the given entity are involved in the relationship.

---

template: cardinality

## Example

A [Cyclops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclopes) has only one eye.

![Cardinality example](../files/erd/cardinality_cyclops.svg)

--

- This diagram also shows that each eye belongs to only one cyclops.

---

template: cardinality

## Example

In the ancient Greek myth of [the Graeae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graeae), three sisters named Pephredo, Enyo, and Dino shared one eye and one tooth.

![Cardinality example](../files/erd/cardinality_graeae.svg)

--

- Each of the Graeae has one eye, indicated by the `1` next to the Eye.
- Each of the Graeae has one tooth, indicated by the `1` next to the Tooth.
- Each eye belongs to multiple Graeae, indicated by the `M` next to the Graeae.
- Each tooth belongs to multiple Graeae, indicated by the `M` next to the Graeae.

---

template: cardinality

## Example

Each painter paints many paintings.

![Cardinality example](../files/erd/cardinality_paintings.svg)

--

- Note that in this model, any given painting must have been painted by only one painter.

--

- If painters can collaborate on paintings, then we would need to indicate that with a many-to-many relationship:

--

![Cardinality example](../files/erd/cardinality_paintings_many.svg)

---

template: cardinality

## Example

Of course painters and paintings most likely have attributes of interest to us.

![Cardinality example](../files/erd/cardinality_paintings_attributes_many.svg)

---

template: cardinality

## Example

A painter might also own one or more dogs.

![Cardinality example](../files/erd/cardinality_painters_dogs.svg)

---

template: cardinality

## Example

But beware... a painter's dog may tear up their painting.

# Perspectives

--

## Concept

How you diagram a model depends on whether you're designing the **conceptual model**, the **logical model**, or the **physical model**.

--

- For small projects, it is sometimes more convenient to jump directly to physical modeling.

--

- For larger, more complex projects, creating an abstract conceptual or logical model is usually beneficial prior to physical modeling and implementation.

---

template: perspectives

## Conceptual model

**Conceptual modeling** involves creating a model of a real world problem that is independent of any physical considerations.

--

- This is very high-level and only shows the most important entities and their relationships.

--

- Typically this is a first-cut model, with insufficient detail to build an actual database.

---

template: perspectives

## Conceptual modeling process

Building a conceptual model involves:

--

- ER diagramming

--

- Removing redundancy (i.e. normalization).

--

- Making sure all intended uses of the data are supported by the design.

---

template: perspectives

## Logical model

Compared to conceptual modeling, a **logical model** shows more detail of all entities and relationships

--

- It is still general and abstract from how the database is actually implemented.

--

- Logical models show the primary key fields, and cardinality of relationships (more on these later).

---

template: perspectives

## Logical modeling process

Building a logical model involves:

--

- Further refine the conceptual model to include all entities and attributes and relationships.

--

- Determine which attributes will serve as primary keys, and [optionally] also foreign keys.

--

- Establishing the cardinality among all entities.

--

- Normalization of those tables, following the standard relational database normal forms.

--

- _We will aim to achieve the logical level of diagramming_.

---

template: perspectives

## Physical model

The **physical model** includes all the same properties as the conceptual and logical models, in addition to more details of how the database will actually be implemented in a particular type of relational database management system.

--

- This is not abstract, but very concrete and specific to an actual database system.

---

template: perspectives

## Physical modeling process

Building a physical modeling involves:

--

- Developing the baseline logical model first.

--

- Establishing database **indices** for increased efficiency.

--
An index is an order or organization of the data in some fields of a table to make retrieval faster and more efficient.

--
Creating indices becomes increasingly important for larger data sets.

--

- Determining data types for each attribute.

--

- Imposing constraints on the data for increased integrity and security.
