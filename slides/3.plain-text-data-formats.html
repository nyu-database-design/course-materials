# Overview

---

template: overview

## Intro
There are boundless possibilities when it comes to representing *structured data* as plain text.

--

In reality, there are just a few common formats that meet most needs.

--

- Comma-Separated Values (CSV)

--

- Javascript Object Notation (JSON)

--

- eXtensible Markup Lanauge (XML)

--

Each of these formats attempts to make data both *human-readable* and *machine-readable*.

--

We will take a quick look at each.

---

name: plain-text

# Plain text

---

template: plain-text

## Meaning
What do we mean by "*plain text*"?

--

- As you've probably heard, all computer data, including all text, is *ultimately stored as numbers* in the computer's processor, memory, and storage.

--

- Plain text, for our purposes, means that computer data which contains only numeric codes in the [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) or [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode) encoding schemes and nothing else.

--

- ASCII and Unicode offer standardized widely-supported encoding schemes that indicate *which number represents which character*.

--

- For example, the [ASCII standard](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=ascii+chart&t=brave&ia=answer&iax=answer) specifies that an `a` character is represented by the number 97, `b` is 98, `c` is 99, and so on.

--

- So any computer data that contains only a set of these codes, and no other numbers not in these encoding schemes, is "plain text" data.

---

## Creating
How do we create plain text data?

--

- A *plain text editor* is an application intended to be used to create plain text files.

--

- Windows' Notepad and Apple's TextEdit are *not good* plain text editors - both can and will store non-plain-text data into the files they make.

--

- Microsoft Word, Apple Pages, and Google Docs are *not good* plain text editors.

--

- Almost all computer programming editors and integrated development environments are **good** plain text editors.

---

## Saving
How to save a file with just plain text in it.

--

- When saving any file, *always include a file extension* in the filename.  This helps the operating system understand what kind of data is in the file and what application it should launch to open it.

--

- A file with *unstructured plain text* is often saved with the `.txt` extension.

--

- A file with *structured plain text* is saved with an extension that matches its structure
--
, e.g.:
    - `.csv` for files containing comma-separated-values data
--
    - `.json` for files containing Javascript Object Notation data
--
    - `.xml` for files containing eXtensible Markup Language data
--
    - ... and so on

--

- A filename such as `diabetes_rates_by_state.csv` is a **good filename**, whereas `diabetes_rates_by_state` is not.

---

template: plain-text

## Opening
How do you open a plain text file?

--

- When you double click on a plain text file and it opens in Windows' Notepad or Mac's TextEdit, *quit those applications immediately* and fix your process!

--

- *Use a good plain text editor* instead.

--

- Open your good plain text editor and from there open the file using the `File`->`Open...` menu.

--

- It's also possible to *change which application is opened by default* when you double-click on a file with a certain extension... look it up.

---

template: plain-text

## One more note about file extensions
Annoyingly perhaps, both Windows and Mac OSX hide file extensions by default.

--

- It is **urgent** that you change this setting on your own computer so that file extensions are always visible.

--

- [Research how to do this](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=show+all+file+extensions+mac+and+windows&t=brave&ia=web) for your operating system.

name: fixed-width

# Fixed-width text

---

template: fixed-width

## Basic concept
Back in the days when paper ruled, it was useful to print data in nicely-aligned tables that were easy to follow on paper.  

--

- Thus was born the fixed-width formatting of text, where data in each column consumes a consistent amount of horizontal space. E.g.:

```bash
Year   Jan  Feb  Mar  Apr  May  Jun  Jul  Aug  Sep  Oct  Nov  Dec    J-D D-N    DJF  MAM  JJA  SON  Year
1880   -29  -18  -11  -20  -12  -23  -21   -9  -16  -23  -20  -23    -19 ***   ****  -14  -18  -20  1880
1881   -16  -17    4    4    2  -20   -7   -3  -14  -21  -22  -11    -10 -11    -18    3  -10  -19  1881
1882    14   15    3  -19  -16  -26  -21   -6  -10  -25  -16  -25    -11 -10      6  -10  -17  -17  1882
```

--

- This example comes from [NASA's records of land and ocean surface temperatures](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/GLB.Ts+dSST.txt), which are [perhaps shockingly] still published in fixed-width text format.

--

- This data is *very print-friendly*, but *machine-unfriendly* - it looks good on paper, but is unnecessarily difficult for a computer program to *parse*.

--

name: csv

# Comma-Separated Values (CSV)

---

template: csv

## Basic concept
When text is formatted as *comma-separated values*, a series of values is separated by commas*!*

--

- *Line breaks* separate series of related values.

--

- For example, three lines could be used to represent three different works of nonsense literature:

 ```csv
 Carroll,Lewis,Jabberwocky,1871
 Lear,Edward,The Jumblies,1910
 Bishop,Elizabeth,The Man-Moth,1946
 ```
--

- Optionally, the first line of a CSV file can contain *headings*:

 ```csv
 Last name,First name,Title,Year
 Carroll,Lewis,Jabberwocky,1871
 Lear,Edward,The Jumblies,1910
 Bishop,Elizabeth,The Man-Moth,1946
 ```

---

template: csv

## Consistency
CSV files are used with a *fixed schema* - a consistent set of fields that are present in each line of the text.

--

- In our example, the *text before the first comma* is always the author's last name, the following *text before the next comma* is the author's first name, and so on.
```csv
Carroll,Lewis,Jabberwocky,1871
Lear,Edward,The Jumblies,1910
Bishop,Elizabeth,The Man-Moth,1946
```

--

- Inconsistently-ordered fields would be unusable by a machine and possibly by a human as well - a CSV would never look like this:
```csv
Carroll,Lewis,Jabberwocky,1871
1910,Edward,Lear,The Jumblies
The Man-Moth,1946,Bishop,Elizabeth
```
---

template: csv
 
## Variation
A variation of the CSV format is the *Tab-Separated Values (TSV)* format.

--

- An example of three lines of tab-separated values used to represent three different works of nonsense literature (the spaces between values are tabs in this case):

 ```csv
 Carroll    Lewis   Jabberwocky 1871
 Lear   Edward  The Jumblies    1910
 Bishop Elizabeth   The Man-Moth  1946
 ```
--

- While *commas are the most common* separators for this kind of format, tabs, colons `:`, semi-colons `;`, and pipes `|` are not uncommon.
 
---

name: json

# Javascript Object Notation (JSON)

---

template: json

## A slightly more flexible format
Javascript Object Notation (JSON) is a competitor format to CSV for representing *structured and less structured data* in text.

--

- For example, the following might be a JSON representation of one work of nonsense literature:

--

 ```json
 {
     "lastName": "Carroll",
     "firstName": "Lewis",
     "title": "Jaberwocky",
     "year": 1871
 }
 ```
--

- Unlike in CSV format, *line breaks, tabs, and spaces are not meaningful* in JSON format and are used solely for human readability.

--

 ```json
 {"last_name": "Carroll", "first_name": "Lewis", "title": "Jaberwocky", "year": 1871}
 ```

---

template: json

## Multiple data series
JSON format is valid Javascript programming code.  So it may not be a surprise that JSON supports arrays/lists of data series.

--

- For example, three works of nonsense literature might be represented:

```json
[
    {"lastName": "Carroll", "firstName": "Lewis", "title": "Jaberwocky", "year": 1871},
    {"lastName": "Lear", "firstName": "Edward", "title": "The Jumblies", "year": 1910},
    {"lastName": "Bishop", "firstName": "Elizabeth", "title": "The Man-Moth", "year": 1946}
]
```

--

- The *square brackets* indicate an array. `[ ... ]` 

--

- *Commas* separate the elements of the array. `[ ... , ... , ... ]`

--

- The *line breaks, tabs, and spaces* are for human-readability only.

---

template: json
 
## Nesting
JSON can support a hierarchical order of data, also known as *nesting* of one object within another.

--

- For example, one could nest the *firstName* and *lastName* fields within an *author* field.

```json
{
    "author": {
        "lastName": "Carroll", 
        "firstName": "Lewis", 
    },
    "title": "Jaberwocky", 
    "year": 1871
}
```

--

- This would not be possible with CSV format.

---

template: json
 
## Less structured data
While JSON, like CSV, is used most commonly for *structured data*, where all series of data have the same fields, this is not a requirement.

--

- For example, some data about three people, with no consistent set of fields:

--

```json
[
    {"name": "Bob", "age": 10},
    {"last_name": "Lear", "first_name": "Edward", "occupation": "naturalist"},
    {"zodiac": "Libra", "first_name": "Juliette", "favorite_animal": "Koala"}
]
```

---

name: xml

# eXtensible Markup Language (XML)

---

template: xml

## Structured data
Like CSV and JSON, *XML* can be used to represent *structured data*.

--

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<nonsense_works>
    <work>
        <last_name>Carroll</last_name>
        <first_name>Lewis</first_name>
        <title>Jabberwocky</title>
        <year>1871</year>
    </work>
    <work>
        <last_name>Lear</last_name>
        <first_name>Edward</first_name>
        <title>The Jumblies</title>
        <year>1910</year>
    </work>
    <work>
        <last_name>Bishop</last_name>
        <first_name>Elizabeth</first_name>
        <title>The Man-Moth</title>
        <year>1946</year>
    </work>
</nonsense_works>
```

---

template: xml

## Tags and markup
XML tags (code words betweeen `<` and `>` signs) are used to annotate the data and explain its meaning.

--

- For example, the title of each work in the preceeding example is clearly surrounded by `title` *tags*:  
```xml
<work>
        <last_name>Bishop</last_name>
        <first_name>Elizabeth</first_name>
        <title>The Man-Moth</title>
        <year>1946</year>
</work>
```

--

- This way of annotating a document with tags is called *markup*.

---

template: xml

## Nesting
As with JSON, XML supports nesting of data, such as placing the `lastName` and `firstName` fields within an `author` field.

--

```xml
    <work>
        <author>
            <last_name>Carroll</last_name>
            <first_name>Lewis</first_name>
        </author>
        <title>Jabberwocky</title>
        <year>1871</year>
    </work>
```

---

template: xml

## For less-structured data
Like, JSON, XML also allows for representing *loosely-structured data* with inconsistent fields, although this is not common:

--

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<people>
    <person>
        <name>Bob</name>
        <age>10</age>
    </person>
    <person>
        <last_name>Lear</last_name>
        <first_name>Edward</first_name>
        <occupation>naturalist</occupation>
    </person>
    <person>
        <zodiac>Libra</zodiac>
        <first_name>Juliette</first_name>
        <favorite_animal>Koala</favorite_animal>
    </person>
</people>
```

---

template: xml

## Similarity to other markup languages
There is a wide variety of subsets of XML for specific purposes.

--

- *Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)* - the language used for marking up almost all web page content (see [example](#html-example))

--
    - The current version, `HTML 5` is not a direct subset of XML, but retains many of the same features as XML.
--
    - the previous version, `XHTML` (eXtensible HyperText Markup Language) was a direct subset of XML and followed all XML rules.

--

- *Real Simple Syndication (RSS)* - used for marking up episodic blog and podcast content (see [example](https://www.cloudwards.net/how-to-set-up-an-rss-feed/))

--

- *Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)* - a text-based format for representing vector graphics (see [examples](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Basic_Shapes))

---

name: html

# HyperText Markup Language (HTML)

---

template: html

## Web publishing
Unlike CSV, JSON, and XML, Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is *not a general-purpose data format*.  

--

- HTML is used almost exclusively to define and structure *content published to web pages*.

--

- HTML today is not a sub-set of XML, but *shares much in common with XML*.

--

- Given that web pages are so important today and hold much of the world's data, HTML, despite its obvious flaws, has become *an important plain text data format*.

## Example
An example of a simple HTML document.

```html
<doctype html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <title>Famous Works of Nonsense Literature</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <section>

template: html

## Challenges
Whereas CSV, JSON, and XML are most often used for packaging data with little consideration to aesthetics, the same cannot be said of HTML.

--

- HTML is *primarily used for publishing web content in a visually-pleasing manner* (to visually-able humans).

--

- HTML *does not require a consistent repeated data structure*, and often does not have one in practice.

--

- There are drastic differences in the way HTML is written from one web page to the next, making it *difficult to parse*.

# Conclusions

## Comparisons
A few points of comparisons among the various plain text data formats:

--

- CSV, JSON, and XML all support structured data

--

- JSON (and in theory XML, but not in practice) supports loosely structured data

--

- HTML is its own unique creature that is *not going away anytime soon*. We must live with its many flaws, and perhaps even learn to love them.
